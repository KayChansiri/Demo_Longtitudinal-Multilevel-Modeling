In today's post, we're going to pivot from our usual focus on machine learning and AI to delve into the world of longitudinal multilevel modeling. This statistical approach is a cornerstone underpinning several ML algorithms, including Generalized Linear Mixed-Model (GLMM) trees. [My previous article](https://towardsdatascience.com/hierarchical-linear-modeling-a-step-by-step-guide-424b486ac6a3) on multilevel modeling, published during my PhD and featured by [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com), reached an audience of over 30,000 readers. With the benefit of further experience and knowledge, I'm excited to revisit this topic and explore MLM for longitudinal data in greater depth.

**The most important aspect of multilevel modeling is understanding how to construct an equation and interpret the model. You don’t have to worry too much about coding; it’s quite straightforward whether you are an R or Python user.** 

# Repeated Measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA)Versus Longitudinal Multilevel Modeling (MLM) 

Before we get started, let’s discuss the differences between RM-ANOVA and Longitudinal MLM (also known as Hierarchical Linear Modeling, Mixed Modeling).

## Repeated Measures ANOVA

* Simpler than MLM, this method is used to detect changes across time points and conditions (e.g., control vs. treatment). The analysis emphasizes whether a main effect of time or a time*treatment interaction exists.
* However, the model does not necessarily consider differences across individuals—such as whether different people have different baselines or if their responses to a predictor vary over time.
* Appropriate when all cases have the same number of data waves, meaning each case is measured the same number of times, and the intervals between measurements are equal.
* Predominantly used for discrete/categorical predictors.
* Time-varying variables, like the wave of measurement, are treated categorically rather than continuously. For continuous predictors, RM-ANCOVA would be utilized.
* Although simpler, it's a general linear model that must meet certain assumptions, including linearity, normal distribution of error, independence of errors, and homogeneity of errors—some of which can be challenging to satisfy with longitudinal data. For example, if you're assessing Netflix user satisfaction with a new feature over three months, RM-ANOVA assumes the variance in satisfaction ratings should be consistent across all time points.
* The model also struggles with missing data, as it employs ordinary least squares. If a user misses a survey, their data is excluded from the analysis.
* Best used for designs with few time points, such as a pre-post design, since only two data points may not adequately capture individual changes over time.
* To learn more about how F statistics for multilevel modeling are calculated, I found [this article](https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/repeated-measures-anova-statistical-guide.php) very helpful.

## MLM

* More complex than RM-ANOV -- this approach captures random effects, including differences in average outcomes (random intercepts) and variations in how predictors relate to outcomes (random slopes) across subjects.
* More flexible than RM-ANOVA, as cases do not need to have the same number of time points or intervals. Note that more data waves are advantageous for capturing changes over time in MLM. At least three time points per subject is recommended.
* Can accommodate both categorical and continuous predictors.
* Can be categorized into general linear mixed models, assuming a normal distribution of errors, or generalized linear mixed models, which do not assume this and can handle categorical outcomes. These models allow for various forms of change over timem including non-linear relationships.
* Handles missing data more effectively than RM-ANOVA by using residual (or restricted) maximum likelihood (REML) for continuous outcomes or maximum likelihood for categorical outcomes, instead of ordinary least squares, which is utilized by RM-ANOVA. Both REML and ML account for non-independence and potential heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation of residuals.

## RM-ANOVA VS MLM Equations
To better understand the differences between those two methods, Let's look at the equations for RM-ANOVA versus MLM using the Netflix example I discussed earlier:

**Repeated Measures ANOVA Equation**: Y<sub>ij</sub> = μ + α<sub>i</sub> + β<sub>j</sub> +(αβ)<sub>ij</sub> +ϵ<sub>ij</sub>
 Y<sub>ij</sub> ​is the satisfaction score for subject i at time j.
 μ is the overall mean satisfaction score.
 α<sub>i</sub> ​and β<sub>j</sub>represent the individual and time effects, respectively.
 (αβ)<sub>ij</sub> is the interaction effect.
 ϵ<sub>ij</sub>​is the error term, assumed to be equally correlated across all observations.

**Multilevel Modeling Equation**:Y<sub>ij</sub>= γ<sub>00</sub>+γ<sub>10</sub>×Time<sub>ij</sub>+u<sub>0i</sub>+u<sub>1i</sub>×Time<sub>ij</sub>+ϵ<sub>ij</sub>
  Y<sub>ij</sub>​ is the satisfaction score for subject i at time j.
  γ<sub>00</sub> and γ<sub>10</sub>are the fixed effects for the intercept and time, respectively.
  u<sub>0i</sub> and u<sub>1i</sub> ​are the random intercept and slope, respectively, capturing individual differences.
  ϵ<sub>ij</sub> ​is the unique error term for each observation.

The error terms in these models are different. MLM accounts for individual differences in satisfaction scores and the relationship between time and satisfaction across individuals. RM-ANOVA, on the other hand, has a single error term.
